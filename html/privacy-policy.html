<p><strong>1.3. Failure to provide information</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>4. Do we use cookies and other tracking technologies?</strong></p>

<p>&zwj;In Short: We may use cookies and other tracking technologies to collect and store your information.</p>

<p>4.1. What are cookies?</p>

<p>Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by website owners in order to make their websites work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.</p>

<p>Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, Roamvy) are called &ldquo;first party cookies&rdquo;. Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called &ldquo;third party cookies&rdquo;. Third party cookies enable third party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website (e.g. like advertising, interactive content and analytics). The parties that set these third-party cookies can recognize your computer both when it visits the website in question and also when it visits certain other websites.</p>

<p>&zwj;4.2. Why do we use cookies?</p>

<p>We use first- and third-party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our Websites to operate, and we refer to these as &ldquo;essential&rdquo; or &ldquo;strictly necessary&rdquo; cookies. Other cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our online properties. Third parties serve cookies through our Websites for advertising, analytics and other purposes. This is described in more detail below.</p>

<p>&zwj;The specific types of first- and third-party cookies served through our Websites and the purposes they perform are described below (please note that the specific cookies served may vary depending on the specific online properties you visit):</p>

<p>Strictly Necessary Cookies: These cookies are essential to provide you with services available through the Services and to enable you to use some of its features. For example, they allow you to log in to secure areas of the sites or applications and help the content of the pages you request load quickly. Without these cookies, the services that you have asked for cannot be provided, and we only use these cookies to provide you with those services.</p>

<p>Functionality Cookies: These cookies allow the Services to remember choices you make when you use a site or application, such as remembering your language preferences, remembering your login details and remembering the changes you make to other parts of your account or preferences. The purpose of these cookies is to provide you with a more personal experience and to avoid you having to re-enter your preferences every time you use the Services.</p>

<p>Performance Cookies: These cookies are used to collect information about traffic to the services and how users use the services. The information gathered does not identify any individual visitor. The information is aggregated and anonymous. It includes the number of visitors to, the websites that referred them, the pages visited, what time of day they visited, whether they have visited before, and other similar information. We use this information to help operate the services more efficiently, to gather broad demographic information and to monitor the level of activity on our services.</p>

<p>4.3. How can I control cookies?</p>

<p>You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies. If you choose to reject cookies, you may still use our website though your access to some functionality and areas of our website may be restricted. You may also set or amend your web browser controls to accept or refuse cookies. As the means by which you can refuse cookies through your web browser controls vary from browser-to-browser, you should visit your browser&rsquo;s help menu for more information.</p>

<p>For cookies related to Google Analytics, refer to: Google AdWords Conversion Tool : Privacy information of the provider(<a href="https://goo.gl/CUUMgi">https://goo.gl/CUUMgi</a>), Link to Opt-Out(<a href="https://goo.gl/ghZWnt">https://goo.gl/ghZWnt</a>). To opt-out of interest-based advertising by advertisers on our Services visit&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/">http://www.aboutads.info/choices/</a>.</p>

<p>4.4. What about other tracking technologies, like web beacons?</p>

<p>Cookies are not the only way to recognize or track visitors to a website. We may use other, similar technologies from time to time, like web beacons (sometimes called &ldquo;tracking pixels&rdquo; or &ldquo;clear gifs&rdquo;). These are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enable us to recognize when someone has visited our Websites or opened an e-mail including them. This allows us, for example, to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within a website to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to the website from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to improve site performance, and to measure the success of email marketing campaigns. In many instances, these technologies rely on cookies to function properly, and so declining cookies will impair their functioning.</p>

<p>4.5. Do you use Flash cookies or Local Shared Objects?</p>

<p>Websites may also use so-called &ldquo;Flash Cookies&rdquo; (also known as Local Shared Objects or &ldquo;LSOs&rdquo;) to, among other things, collect and store information about your use of our services, fraud prevention and for other site operations.</p>

<p>If you do not want Flash Cookies stored on your computer, you can adjust the settings of your Flash player to block Flash Cookies storage using the tools contained in the Website Storage Settings Panel. You can also control Flash Cookies by going to the Global Storage Settings Panel and following the instructions (which may include instructions that explain, for example, how to delete existing Flash Cookies (referred to &ldquo;information&rdquo; on the Macromedia site), how to prevent Flash LSOs from being placed on your computer without your being asked, and (for Flash Player 8 and later) how to block Flash Cookies that are not being delivered by the operator of the page you are on at the time).</p>

<p>&zwj;Setting the Flash Player to restrict or limit acceptance of Flash Cookies may reduce or impede the functionality of some Flash applications, including, potentially, Flash applications used in connection with our services or online content.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>5. How do we handle your social logins?</strong></p>

<p>&zwj;In Short: If you choose to register or log in to our services using a social media account, we may have access to certain information about you.</p>

<p>Our Services offer you the ability to register and login using your third-party social media account details (like your Google, Facebook or Apple logins). Where you choose to do this, we will receive certain profile information about you from your social media provider. The profile Information we receive varies depending on the social media provider concerned, but will often include your name, email address, friends list, profile picture as well as other information you choose to make public on such a social media platform.</p>

<p>&zwj;We will use the information we receive only for the purposes described in this privacy notice or that are otherwise made clear to you on the relevant Services. We do not control, and are not responsible for, other uses of your personal information by your third-party social media provider. You may review their privacy notice to understand how they collect, use and share your personal information, and how you can set your privacy preferences on their sites and apps.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>6. What is our stance on third-party websites?</strong></p>

<p>&zwj;In Short: We are not responsible for the safety of any information that you share with third-party providers who advertise, but are not affiliated with, our Website.</p>

<p>The Services may contain advertisements from third parties that are not affiliated with us and which may link to other websites, online services or mobile applications. We cannot guarantee the safety and privacy of data you provide to any third parties. Any data collected by third parties is not covered by this privacy notice. We are not responsible for the content or privacy and security practices and policies of any third parties, including other websites, services or applications that may be linked to or from the Services. You should review the policies of such third parties and contact them directly to respond to your questions.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>7. How long do we keep your information?</strong></p>

<p>&zwj;In Short: We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy notice unless otherwise required by law.</p>

<p>We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting or other legal requirements). We may hold certain types of data as outlined in the table below past the termination of the user&rsquo;s account:</p>

<p>Data Retained Retention Period</p>

<p>Provision of the Service(s) 12 Months or As Required by Legislation</p>

<p>Data Usage 12 Months or As Required by Legislation</p>

<p>Invoices and Billing Records 7 Years</p>

<p>Customer Support Records 3 Years</p>

<p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>8. How do we keep your information safe?</strong></p>

<p>&zwj;In Short: We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security measures.</p>

<p>We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process, including data encryption, data anonymization wherever possible, and use of highly secure servers (both electronically and physically secured). However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security, and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>9. What are your privacy rights?</strong></p>

<p>&zwj;In Short:* You have rights that allow you access to and control over your personal information. You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time.</p>

<p>You have the right:</p>

<p>to request access and obtain a copy of your personal information,</p>

<p>to request rectification or erasure,</p>

<p><strong>10. Children&rsquo;s Policy</strong></p>

<p>Roamvy is not directed to children under the age of 13 years. The Service is also not offered to children whose age makes it illegal to process their personal data or requires parental consent for the processing of their personal data under the GDPR or other local law.</p>

<p>We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under 13 years or under the applicable age limit (the &ldquo;Age Limit&rdquo;). If you are under the Age Limit, please do not use the Services, and do not provide any personal data to us.</p>

<p>If you are a parent of a child under the Age Limit and become aware that your child has provided personal data to Roamvy, please contact us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:privacy@getroamvy.com">privacy@roamvy.com</a></p>

<p>&zwj;If we learn that we have collected the personal data of a child under the age of 13 years, we will take reasonable steps to delete the personal data. This may require us to delete the Roamvy account for that child.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>11. Controls for do-not-track features</strong></p>

<p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track (&ldquo;DNT&rdquo;) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.</p>

<p>Verification process:</p>

<p>Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity to determine you are the same person about whom we have the information in our system. These verification efforts require us to ask you to provide information so that we can match it with the information you have previously provided us. For instance, depending on the type of request you submit, we may ask you to provide certain information so that we can match the information you provide with the information we already have on file, or we may contact you through a different communication method (e.g. phone or email) that you have previously identified to us. We may also use other verification methods as the circumstances require.</p>

<p>We will only use personal information provided in your request to verify your identity or authority to make the request. To the extent possible, we will avoid requesting additional information from you for the purposes of verification. If, however, we cannot verify your identity from the information already maintained by us, we may request that you provide additional information for the purposes of verifying your identity, and for security or fraud-prevention purposes. We will delete such additionally provided information as soon as we finish verifying your identity.</p>
